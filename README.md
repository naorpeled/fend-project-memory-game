# Memory Game Project
## About 
In this repository you will find my solution to the Memory Game project from Udacity's Front End Nanodegree. This project explores basic concepts regarding Javascript.

## Features
- A game timer
- Stars rating (3 stars = 8 moves, 2 stars < 17 moves)

## Instructions
Pick two cards each time, if the item on them is identical they stay opened.
Once you've revealed all the pairs you win the game :)
